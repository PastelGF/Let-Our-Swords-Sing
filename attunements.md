# Attunements

## Techniques
Techniques are martial abilities used by expert soldiers. Techniques are not normal abilities, such as swinging a sword, but instead require specialized training. When you attune a technique, gain one of the following options:

1. As an action, protect an ally. All damage from non-blast sources that ally would take, you instead take.
2. After attacking an enemy, you disengage from combat with them.
3. As an action, you can grant an ally a tactical bonus, granting them advantage on their next attack or similar option.
4. Using both actions, you can make both a melee and a ranged attack this turn.
5. Whenever you notch armor to reduce damage, instead reduce it to 0.
6. You may use a shield as an effective weapon. Small shields are fast, and large shields are slow.
7. You are able to dual wield effectively. Use the speed of your slowest weapon, but roll both weapons when determining damage (take the highest roll).
8. Whenever you are attacking an unaware enemy, you wound them.
9. You may gain a wound to increase your SAVE by 2. This lasts until your next succesful save.
10. As an action, you can parry. When attacked, make a check with your core attribute with difficulty equal to the damage taken. If you succeed, you take no damage and can attack the target for free.
11. Whenever you charge, you can still notch armor that turn.
12. You may attack enemies you are grappling, automatically dealing maximum damage. You can also climb onto creatures larger than you. Attacking a creature like this grants you advantage.

## Masteries
Masteries represent specialized training, skills, or items that allow one to do the near impossible. taking the form of a teacher, item, place, or pet. When you attune a mastery, pick two options and determine which is active. You can change which is active with a day of training.

All rolls in which your active masteries are helpful gain +1. You can also activate your mastery to allow you to do the near-impossible without rolling. Spent masteries are returned on a full rest.

For example, a ranger attuned to her bow might be able to easily make a shot at 200 feet away, or she might use her attuned bloodhound to find the bandits she has been trailing for weeks.

## Trophies
Trophies are representations of slain enemies that grant power to their weilder. When you attune to a trophy, determine what creature it's from and then gain the following benefits:

- +2 damage against creatures of the same type.
- An ability of that creature, such as the flame breath of a dragon. This ability cannot change.

At 1st level, a trophy should be anything reasonable for your character to have killed, such as a goblin. At higher levels, trophies should be anything your character has killed and taken a trophy from, only getting magic from it once they attune to it.

## Elder Weapons
Elder Weapons are ancient and powerful items with minds of their own. Elder weapons are:

- Intelligent thinking beings with minds of their own.
- GMs should determine the weapons goals, and have it work to convince its wielder to follow through on them, and even refuse to work if the PC continuously refuses to assist it.

When you attune to an elder weapon, you gain the following benefits:

- +1 attack bonus when using the weapon.
- The weapon also has three notches which can be used to perform special magic inherint to the weapon, as granted by the GM. These notches are restored like normal, but when used up the weapon is not destroyed.

It doesn't make a lot of sense for a 1st level character to have an elder weapon, but if you truly desire one work with your GM. At higher levels, you should only attune to an elder weapon if you have found in the game.

## Miracles
Miracles are magic, or anything close enough to be recognizable as magic (such as psionics or powerful technology). Each miracle has a name, such as "Fireball" or "Malinibob, Demon of Rot" or "Orbital Strike". Whenever a miracle is used, an action is chosen that could be reasonably described by the name of the miracle. The miracle "Flames" could be used to creatre a bolt of flame, or to start a fire. When a miracle is used, a character must expend magic die (MD) granted to them by their equipment to cast it, or they must expend their own life force to create magic die (for each wound they take, they get one temporary MD). MD are consumed on a roll of 4-6, but are not on a roll of 1-3 (MD from taking wounds are always consumed).

Miracles can perform several effects:

- Damaging miracles generally deal damage equal to the sum of the MD spent. MD can also be spent to alter the spell, such as increasing its range, making the spell subtle and imnpossible to notice, or changing it to a blast.
- Hindering, but not damaging, spells require a check with a difficulty equal to the number of MD spent.
- Spells that do no harm consume MD based on what they effect. Personal effects consume 1 MD, room-sized effects consume 2, large-scale and powerful effects consume 3, and reality altering magics consuem 4.

Miracles with very specific names are encouraged to be more powerful than vague ones. For example "Ice Lance" could deal additional damage equal to the number of dice rolled as compared to "Flames". Simply be consistant.

WHenever you attune to a miracle, pick two names and determine which is active. You can change which is active with a day of meditations.
