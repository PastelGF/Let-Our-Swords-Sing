# Character Creation

## Ability Scores
Characters in Let Our Swords Sing have 4 ability scores:
- Strength (STR): physical might and constitution. Your Inventory slots are equal to your STR (minimum 8).
- Dexterity (DEX): agility and deftness. You gain a +1 to initiative at 13 and 16 DEX.
- Lore (LOR): knowledge and understanding. You gain +1 language at 13 and 16 LOR.
- Will (WIL): force of will and personality. You gain +1 to your SAVE at 13 and 16 WIL.

To determine these scores at level one, roll 3d6 in order, then increase one by +2. Your highest ability score is your "core attribute".

## HP and Saves

You start with 1d6 Hit Protection (HP) and a SAVE of 6.

## Tags

Each of your ability scores and your SAVE can have up to 2 tags. Tags represent additional factors that might come into play when rolling your score or SAVE. Tags come in one of four forms:

- Trait: aspects of your physical being, such as old or gambler
- Ancestry: the species your character belongs too, such as elf or dwarf (but not the most standard species in a setting, usually human)
- Job: the work your character did/does, such as assassin or guard
- Affiliation: groups your character has worked with, such as a thieves guild or a knightly order

Whenever an ability score or SAVE is rolled, tags eitehr apply advantage (if they are actively helpful to the situation), or disadvantage (if they are actively harmful to the situation).

For example: a thief rolling DEX to attempt to lockpick a door would gain advantage from their tag of "thieve's guild", as their working with the guild almost certainly helped them learn to lockpick.

At level one you start with 2 tags. For each ability score you have that is less than 5, get an additional tag.

## Attunements

At level 1, each character has 2 attunement slots. Attunements can be filled with one of the following:

- Techniques: martial abilities that can be called upon
- Masteries: specialzied uses of items or training that allow the near-impossible
- Trophies: the parts of a slain creature that impart some of its power, as well as granting a bonus against it
- Elder Weapons: intelligent and powerful items of immense power (only one per character)
- Miracles: magic, or anything close enough to magic to be indestuingashable to the untrained eye

For each attunement slot, pick one of the above options.

## Equipment

You start with silver coins equal to your core attribute times 10. You may now purchase equipment.

You have inventory slots equal to your STR score, with a minimum of 8. Most items consume one slot, though heavy items consume two and petty items (such as silver coins) consume none.

## Languages

All PC's share the most common language of the land. PC's with a high LOR start knowing addiitonal languages.

## Attack Bonus

You gain an attack bonus of +1 if your core attribute is at least 13, and an additional +1 if it is at least 16.

## Identity

At this point, you may decide your character's name, personality traits, and appearance.
